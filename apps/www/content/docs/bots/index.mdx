## Overview

The Bots package provides a modern, type-safe foundation for building multi-platform chatbots in ZyntraJS applications. Whether you're creating a Telegram bot, WhatsApp integration, or supporting multiple messaging platforms, this package gives you a unified, extensible API with excellent developer experience.

<Callout type="info">
  The Bots package is currently in **alpha**. The public API may evolve to improve developer experience and internal consistency before the first stable release.
</Callout>

### Key Features

- **Multi-Platform**: First-party adapters for Telegram and WhatsApp Cloud API
- **Adapter Pattern**: Clean, extensible architecture for adding new messaging providers
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod runtime validation
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Express-like chain for cross-cutting concerns (auth, metrics, rate limiting)
- **Command System**: Aliases, help text, and structured command handling
- **Mention Detection**: Configurable bot handle activation for group contexts
- **Structured Logging**: Pluggable logger interface for consistent logging
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and `BotError` class for better observability
- **Lightweight**: Tree-shakeable exports with no hidden side effects
- **Extensible**: Dynamic runtime registration of adapters, commands, and middleware

## Architecture

The Bots system follows ZyntraJS's adapter pattern. The core `Bot` class provides a unified interface while adapters handle platform-specific logic.

      <Tab value="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install @zyntra-js/bot
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm add @zyntra-js/bot
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add @zyntra-js/bot
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
        ```bash
        bun add @zyntra-js/bot
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Create Your First Bot
    
    Create a bot instance with a simple command:
    
    ```typescript
    import { Bot, telegram } from '@zyntra-js/bot'
    
    const bot = Bot.create({
      id: 'demo-bot',
      name: 'Demo Bot',
      adapters: {
        telegram: telegram({
          token: process.env.TELEGRAM_TOKEN!,
          handle: '@demo_bot',
          webhook: {
            url: process.env.TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL!,
            secret: process.env.TELEGRAM_SECRET
          }
        })
      },
      commands: {
        start: Bot.command({
          name: 'start',
          aliases: ['hello'],
          description: 'Greets the user',
          help: 'Use /start to receive a welcome message.',
          async handle(ctx) {
            await ctx.bot.send({
              provider: ctx.provider,
              channel: ctx.channel.id,
              content: { type: 'text', content: '👋 Welcome, friend!' }
            })
          }
        })
      }
    })
    
    await bot.start()
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Handle Webhooks
    
    Create a webhook handler to receive messages from Telegram:
    
    ```typescript
    // Next.js API Route example
    export async function POST(req: Request) {
      return bot.handle('telegram', req)
    }
    ```
  </Step>

## Example Use Cases

The Bots package is flexible enough to power a wide variety of applications. Here are some common use cases where bots shine:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Customer Support Bots">
    Handle support requests across multiple platforms from a single codebase. Users can reach out via Telegram or WhatsApp, and your bot can route conversations, answer FAQs, and escalate complex issues to human agents. Perfect for businesses that need to provide consistent support across different messaging channels.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Notification Systems">
    Send alerts and updates via Telegram or WhatsApp. Perfect for monitoring systems, deployment notifications, or keeping users informed about important events in your application. Build reliable notification systems that reach users where they already are.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automation">
    Trigger actions in your application from chat commands. Build admin interfaces, deploy workflows, or control IoT devices—all through simple chat commands that users can execute from their phones. Transform complex operations into simple, accessible commands.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi-Platform Chatbots">
    Support users on Telegram, WhatsApp, and more from a single codebase. Write your bot logic once, and it works across all platforms—no need to maintain separate implementations for each messaging service. Reduce complexity and maintenance overhead while reaching more users.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
