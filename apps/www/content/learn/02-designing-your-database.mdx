Now that your project is set up, let's design the database. For Shortify, we need to store three main types of information: users, shortened links, and clicks.

## The Data Model

Before writing any code, it's crucial to understand what data our application needs to store and how different pieces of data relate to each other. This upfront planning prevents costly refactoring later.

Our SaaS needs three core models that work together to provide the link shortening functionality:

```prisma
// Users who create and manage links
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  links     Link[]
}

// Shortened links created by users
model Link {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  shortCode String   @unique
  url       String
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  clicks    Click[]
}

// Click events tracked for analytics
model Click {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  linkId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  link      Link     @relation(fields: [linkId], references: [id])
}
```

### Understanding the Design

Let's break down why we designed the schema this way:

- **User Model**: Stores the essential authentication information. The `email` field is marked as `@unique` to prevent duplicate accounts. The `password` field will store a hashed version (never plain text!). The `links` field creates a one-to-many relationship—one user can have many links.

- **Link Model**: This is the heart of our application. The `shortCode` is what appears in the short URL (e.g., `short.ly/github`), and it must be unique. The `url` is the original long URL we're shortening. The `userId` creates the relationship back to the user who owns this link.

- **Click Model**: Keeps it simple for analytics. Each time someone clicks a link, we create a new `Click` record. This gives us basic analytics like total clicks and click timestamps without the complexity of geolocation or device tracking.

## Creating the Schema

Prisma uses a declarative schema language that's both human-readable and type-safe. When you ran `zyntra init`, it created a basic `prisma/schema.prisma` file. Let's build upon it.

Open the file `prisma/schema.prisma`. You'll see the foundational configuration:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The `generator` section tells Prisma to generate a TypeScript client, and the `datasource` section configures the PostgreSQL connection using an environment variable for security.

Now, add the three models we designed above to this file:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  links     Link[]
}

model Link {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  shortCode String   @unique
  url       String
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  clicks    Click[]
}

model Click {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  linkId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  link      Link     @relation(fields: [linkId], references: [id])
}
```

## Setting Up the Database

Before we can apply this schema, we need to ensure PostgreSQL is running. If you selected Docker during setup, start it with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL in the background. The `-d` flag means "detached mode"—it runs without blocking your terminal.

Now, push the schema to your database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This single command does three powerful things:
1. **Reads** your `schema.prisma` file
2. **Creates** all the tables in PostgreSQL with the correct structure
3. **Generates** the Prisma Client with full TypeScript types

You should see output confirming that your database is now synchronized with your schema.

<Callout type="info">
**Why `db push` instead of `migrate`?**  
During development, `db push` is faster and more flexible—it applies changes directly without creating migration files. When you're ready for production, you'll use `prisma migrate` to create versioned migration files that can be safely applied to production databases.
</Callout>

## Exploring with Prisma Studio

Prisma includes a powerful visual database browser that makes it incredibly easy to inspect and manipulate your data during development.

Launch it with:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens a web interface at `http://localhost:5555` where you can:
- **View all tables** and their data in a clean UI
- **Create records** manually without writing SQL
- **Edit and delete** data with a few clicks
- **Test relationships** by navigating between related records

<Callout type="success">
**Pro Tip**: Keep Prisma Studio open in a browser tab while you develop. It's invaluable for quickly checking if your API endpoints are creating data correctly!
</Callout>

## Adding Seed Data

Starting with an empty database makes testing difficult. Let's create a seed script that populates the database with sample data.

Create a new file at `prisma/seed.ts`:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // Clean the database
  await prisma.click.deleteMany()
  await prisma.link.deleteMany()
  await prisma.user.deleteMany()

  // Create a test user
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: await bcrypt.hash('password123', 10),
      name: 'Test User',
    },
  })

  // Create sample links
  await prisma.link.createMany({
    data: [
      {
        shortCode: 'github',
        url: 'https://github.com',
        userId: user.id,
      },
      {
        shortCode: 'zyntra',
        url: 'https://zyntrajs.com',
        userId: user.id,
      },
    ],
  })

  console.log('✅ Database seeded successfully!')
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e)
    process.exit(1)
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

This seed script is straightforward but powerful. It clears existing data (useful for development resets), creates a test user with a securely hashed password, and adds a couple of sample links.

Now configure the seed script in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install bcryptjs
npm install -D @types/bcryptjs tsx
```

Finally, run the seed:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

Open Prisma Studio again, and you'll see your test data! You now have a user you can log in with and some links to work with.
