Welcome to the ZyntraJS course! In this **free, interactive course**, you'll learn how to build a full-stack SaaS application by creating a complete **link shortening service** from scratch.

## What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll build **Shortify** - a production-ready link shortening SaaS with real-world features:

- **🔐 Authentication** - Secure user registration and login with Better Auth
- **🔗 Link Management** - Create, edit, and delete shortened links with custom slugs
- **📊 Analytics Dashboard** - Track clicks, locations, devices, and user behavior
- **🤖 AI-Powered Features** - Generate smart slugs and suggestions using AI
- **💳 Subscription Plans** - Monetize with Stripe integration (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- **⚡ High Performance** - Caching with Redis and background jobs with BullMQ
- **🚀 Production Ready** - Deploy to Vercel with proper monitoring and observability

By the end of this course, you'll have a **complete, deployable application** and the knowledge to build your own SaaS products with ZyntraJS.

## What is ZyntraJS?

**ZyntraJS** is a modern, type-safe framework for building full-stack TypeScript applications. It provides:

- **End-to-end type safety** from database to UI
- **Developer-first experience** with excellent tooling and CLI
- **Framework agnostic** - works with Next.js, Vite, Remix, and more
- **Production ready** - built-in support for caching, jobs, telemetry, and monitoring
- **Plugin ecosystem** - easily extend with adapters for Redis, BullMQ, OpenTelemetry, and more

Think of it as the **backend framework you've been missing** - it brings the same level of type safety and developer experience to your API that you enjoy with modern frontend frameworks.

## How the Course Works

This isn't a passive tutorial where you copy and paste code. You'll **learn by building**, step by step:

### 1. **Setup & Scaffold**
Start with the ZyntraJS CLI to create a new project with all the right tools configured for you.

### 2. **Build Features Incrementally**
Each chapter adds new functionality to your application:
- Design your database schema
- Generate CRUD operations automatically
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement business logic

### 3. **Test in Real-Time**
Use the built-in Zyntra Studio to test your API as you build it - no Postman or cURL needed.

### 4. **Deploy to Production**
Learn the best practices for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining your application.

## What You'll Learn

Here's a breakdown of the skills you'll develop:

### **Core Concepts**
- Understanding ZyntraJS architecture and philosophy
- Working with Controllers, Actions, and Procedures
- Managing application context and dependency injection
- Type-safe API design patterns

### **Database & Data**
- Designing schemas with Prisma
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Data validation with Zod
- Database migrations and seeding

### **Authentication & Security**
- Setting up Better Auth
- Protected routes and middleware
- Session management

- AI integration for smart features
- Payment processing with Stripe
- Real-time analytics

### **DevOps & Deployment**
- Environment configuration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and observability
- Performance optimization
