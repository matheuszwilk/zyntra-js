## The ZyntraJS CLI

The **ZyntraJS CLI** is your best friend for building applications with ZyntraJS. It's a powerful command-line tool that:

- 🏗️ **Scaffolds new projects** with interactive setup
- 🔄 **Generates features** automatically from Prisma schemas
- 📝 **Creates controllers and procedures** with proper structure
- 🔍 **Generates TypeScript client** and OpenAPI docs automatically
- 🚀 **Runs development server** with hot-reload and interactive dashboard

Think of it as your personal assistant that handles all the boilerplate so you can focus on building features.

## Creating Your Project

Let's create your link shortening SaaS! Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx @zyntra-js/cli init shortify
```

This command launches an **interactive setup wizard** that will guide you through configuring your project.

<Callout type="info" title="Using a different package manager?">
The CLI works with any package manager:
- **npm**: `npx @zyntra-js/cli init shortify`
- **pnpm**: `pnpx @zyntra-js/cli init shortify`
- **yarn**: `yarn dlx @zyntra-js/cli init shortify`
- **bun**: `bunx @zyntra-js/cli init shortify`
</Callout>

## Interactive Setup Wizard

The CLI will ask you a series of questions to customize your project. Here's what to choose for our SaaS:

### 1. **Select a Framework**

```
? Which framework would you like to use?
  ❯ Next.js (Recommended for full-stack apps)
    Vite (For frontend + separate API)
    Remix
    Express
    Tanstack Start
```

**Choose: Next.js** - It's perfect for full-stack applications and gives us Server Components, API Routes, and excellent TypeScript support.

### 2. **Choose Your Database**

```
? Which database would you like to use?
  ❯ PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
    MySQL
    SQLite (For development only)
    None (I'll set it up later)
```

**Choose: PostgreSQL** - It's robust, scalable, and has excellent Prisma support. We'll use a free hosted instance later.

### 3. **Select Your ORM**

```
? Which ORM would you like to use?
  ❯ Prisma (Recommended - Type-safe, great DX)
    Drizzle
    None
```

**Choose: Prisma** - Best developer experience, auto-generated types, and amazing tooling.

### 4. **Choose Features**

```
? Select the features you want to enable (use space to select):
  ◯ Store (Redis caching)
  ◯ Jobs (Background task processing with BullMQ)
  ◯ Logging (Structured logging)
  ◯ Telemetry (OpenTelemetry for monitoring)
```

**For now, let's start simple and select:**
- ✅ **Logging** - Essential for debugging
- ✅ **Telemetry** - Good to have from the start

We'll add Store and Jobs later when we implement analytics and background processing.

### 5. **Package Manager**

```
? Which package manager would you like to use?
  ❯ npm
    pnpm
    yarn
    bun
```

**Choose your preferred package manager** - I recommend **pnpm** or **bun** for faster installs, but **npm** works perfectly fine too.

### 6. **Additional Options**

```
? Would you like to initialize a Git repository? (Y/n)
? Would you like to set up Docker Compose? (Y/n)
? Would you like to install dependencies now? (Y/n)
```

- **Git**: ✅ Yes (essential for version control)
- **Docker Compose**: ❌ No (we'll use cloud services)
- **Install dependencies**: ✅ Yes (saves time)

## What Just Happened?

After you complete the wizard, the CLI will:

1. ✨ **Create your project directory** (`shortify/`)
2. 📦 **Generate all necessary files** (configuration, boilerplate, etc.)
3. 🔧 **Configure your selected features**
4. 📥 **Install all dependencies**
5. 🎯 **Initialize a Git repository**
6. 🎉 **Display next steps**

You'll see output like this:

```bash
✔ Project created successfully!
✔ Dependencies installed
✔ Git repository initialized

🎉 Your ZyntraJS project is ready!

📁 Project: shortify
🚀 Framework: Next.js
💾 Database: PostgreSQL (Prisma)
✨ Features: Logging, Telemetry

Next steps:
  1. cd shortify
  2. Copy .env.example to .env and configure your environment
  3. Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server

Happy building! 🔥
```

## Exploring Your Project

Let's navigate into your new project and explore what was generated:

```bash
cd shortify
```

Here's the structure you'll see:

<Files>
  <Folder name="shortify" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="app">
        <File name="layout.tsx" />
        <File name="page.tsx" />
        <Folder name="api">
          <Folder name="[[...zyntra]]">
            <File name="route.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="features">
        <Folder name="user">
          <Folder name="controllers">
            <File name="user.controller.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="services">
        <File name="logger.ts" />
        <File name="telemetry.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <File name="zyntra.ts" />
      <File name="zyntra.context.ts" />
      <File name="zyntra.router.ts" />
      <File name="zyntra.client.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="prisma">
      <File name="schema.prisma" />
    </Folder>
    <File name=".env.example" />
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="next.config.ts" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Key Files Explained

Let's understand what each important file does:

**`src/zyntra.ts`**
The main ZyntraJS instance. This is where you configure all your features, adapters, and plugins.

```typescript
// This file was generated with your selected features
export const zyntra = Zyntra
  .context(createZyntraAppContext())
  .logger(logger)           // ← You selected Logging
  .telemetry(telemetry)     // ← You selected Telemetry
  .config({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    basePATH: '/api/v1',
  })
  .create()
```

**`src/zyntra.router.ts`**
Your API router. All controllers are registered here.

```typescript
export const AppRouter = zyntra.router({
  controllers: {
    user: userController, // ← User controller
    // Your new controllers will be added here
  },
})
```

**`src/app/api/[[...zyntra]]/route.ts`**
The Next.js API route that connects ZyntraJS to Next.js. This is the magic glue!

**`prisma/schema.prisma`**
Your database schema. We'll design our tables here in the next chapter.

  ]}
  explanation="The CLI runs an interactive setup wizard that asks you about your framework, database, features, and preferences, then generates a fully customized project structure based on your answers."
/>

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running your project, you need to configure environment variables. The CLI created an `.env.example` file with all the variables you need.

Copy it to create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open `.env` in your code editor. You'll see something like:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/shortify?schema=public"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# ZyntraJS
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZYNTRA_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZYNTRA_API_BASE_PATH="/api/v1"
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Don't worry about the database yet!">
We'll set up a free PostgreSQL database in the next chapter. For now, you can leave the `DATABASE_URL` as is - we won't be using the database yet.
</Callout>

## Running Your Development Server

Now for the exciting part - let's start your application! Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command does three things:
1. 🔄 Starts the Next.js development server
2. 🔥 Starts ZyntraJS with hot-reload
3. 🎯 Opens Zyntra Studio (interactive API dashboard)

You'll see output like:

```bash
▲ Next.js 15.0.0
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Network:      http://192.168.1.100:3000

🔥 ZyntraJS
  ✓ Router loaded successfully
  ✓ 1 controller registered (user)
  ✓ 1 endpoint available
  ✓ Client schema generated
  ✓ OpenAPI docs generated

📚 Zyntra Studio: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/studio
📖 OpenAPI Docs: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs

Ready in 1.2s
```

## Testing Your API

Open your browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000** - Your Next.js homepage
**http://localhost:3000/api/v1/studio** - Zyntra Studio (API dashboard)

### Using Zyntra Studio

Zyntra Studio is an **interactive API playground** that lets you:
- 📋 See all your endpoints
- 🧪 Test API calls directly in the browser
- 📝 View request/response schemas
- 🔍 Inspect the generated TypeScript types

Try calling the user endpoint:
1. Click on **"user"** in the sidebar
2. Click on **"GET /"**
3. Click **"Execute"**

You should see a response:

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" }
  ]
}
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** Your ZyntraJS application is running!

## Understanding the CLI Commands

Now that your project is running, let's learn about the other powerful CLI commands you'll use throughout development:

### `zyntra dev`

```bash
npx zyntra dev
```

Starts the development server with:
- 🔥 **Hot-reload** for ZyntraJS changes
- 🚀 **Framework server** (Next.js in our case)
- 🎯 **Interactive dashboard** with live API explorer
- 📖 **Auto-generated OpenAPI docs**

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
The `dev` command is smart! It automatically detects your framework (Next.js) and runs the appropriate commands. You can also customize it with flags:

```bash
npx zyntra dev --port 4000        # Custom port
npx zyntra dev --no-interactive   # Disable interactive mode
```
</Callout>

### `zyntra generate schema`

```bash
npx zyntra generate schema
```

Generates the **TypeScript client** from your ZyntraJS router. This runs automatically during `dev`, but you can also run it manually for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Pre-commit hooks
- Manual type generation

### `zyntra generate docs`

```bash
npx zyntra generate docs
```

Generates **OpenAPI specification** and optionally a **Scalar UI** for your API documentation.

```bash
npx zyntra generate docs --ui   # Generate interactive HTML docs
```

### `zyntra generate feature`

```bash
npx zyntra generate feature users --schema prisma:User
```

This is where the magic happens! This command:
1. Reads your Prisma schema
2. Generates a complete CRUD controller
3. Creates type-safe queries and mutations
4. Sets up proper file structure

We'll use this extensively in Chapter 4!

## Project Structure Deep Dive

Let's understand how your project is organized:

### Frontend Layer (`src/app/`)

```
src/app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout, providers
├── page.tsx            # Homepage
└── api/
    └── [[...zyntra]]/ # ZyntraJS catch-all route
        └── route.ts
```

This is your **Next.js App Router** structure. The `[[...zyntra]]` route is special - it catches all API requests and forwards them to ZyntraJS.

### Backend Layer (`src/features/`)

```
src/features/
└── user/
    └── controllers/
        └── user.controller.ts
```

This is your **ZyntraJS API**. Each feature is self-contained with its controllers, procedures, and business logic. This **feature-based architecture** keeps your code organized as your app grows.

### Configuration (`src/zyntra.*.ts`)

```
src/
├── zyntra.ts          # Main Zyntra instance
├── zyntra.context.ts  # Application context & DI
├── zyntra.router.ts   # API router
└── zyntra.client.ts   # Auto-generated client
```

These files work together to create your API:
- **`zyntra.ts`**: Configures features and adapters
- **`zyntra.context.ts`**: Defines what's available globally (DB, logger, etc.)
- **`zyntra.router.ts`**: Registers all your controllers
- **`zyntra.client.ts`**: Auto-generated type-safe client for the frontend

### Services (`src/services/`)

```
src/services/
├── logger.ts       # Structured logging
└── telemetry.ts    # OpenTelemetry setup
```

These are your **infrastructure services** - things like logging, caching, job processing, etc.

## Next Steps

Your development environment is ready! You've:
- ✅ Created a new ZyntraJS project with the CLI
- ✅ Configured your project with the right features
- ✅ Started your development server
