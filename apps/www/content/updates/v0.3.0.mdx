title: "v0.3.0 - Breaking Changes & Major Improvements"
description: "Major release introducing breaking changes, MCP adapter refactoring, new Bot package, and significant improvements to type safety and developer experience."
---

Released on October 22, 2025

## Major Features

### MCP Adapter API Refactoring

The MCP adapter has been completely refactored for better type safety and developer experience:

- **New Function Signature**: Changed from `createMcpAdapter(router, options)` to `createMcpAdapter(options)` where `router` is now a required property in the options object
- **Automatic Context Inference**: The `context` function option has been removed. Context is now automatically inferred from the router's built-in context
- **Custom Prompts**: Register prompts that AI agents can use to guide interactions
- **Custom Resources**: Expose resources that AI agents can read
- **OAuth Authorization**: First-class support for OAuth-based authorization with automatic Bearer token verification

### New Bot Package

Introducing `@zyntra-js/bot` - a comprehensive package for building chatbots with adapters for Telegram and WhatsApp:

- Type-safe bot adapters
- Command handling system
- Message types and middleware support
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Core Improvements

- **Improved Type Inference**: Enhanced type inference for server caller with `InferServerRouterCaller`
- **Builder Pattern API**: Updated API to use builder pattern consistently
- **Request Raw Access**: Added `request.raw` access in controller actions
- **Caller Property**: Added `caller` property to router (replacing `$caller`)
- **Procedure Context**: Improved procedure context with better type inference

## Breaking Changes

### MCP Adapter Migration

If you're using the MCP adapter, you'll need to update your code:

```typescript
// Before (v0.2.x)
const handler = createMcpAdapter(AppRouter, {
  serverInfo: { name: 'My Server', version: '1.0.0' },
  context: (req) => ({
    context: { user: 'test' },
    tools: [],
    request: req,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  })
});

// After (v0.3.x)
const handler = createMcpAdapter({
  router: AppRouter,
  serverInfo: { name: 'My Server', version: '1.0.0' },
  // context is automatically inferred!
});
```

### Caller Property Rename

The `$caller` property has been renamed to `caller`:

```typescript
// Before
const result = await router.$caller({}).action();

// After
const result = await router.caller({}).action();
```

### Middleware Removal

Middlewares have been removed from the Zyntra Builder. Use procedures with middleware instead.
