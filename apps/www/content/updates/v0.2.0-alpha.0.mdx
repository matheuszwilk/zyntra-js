Released on June 30, 2025

## Major Features

### Modular Architecture

ZyntraJS is now a fully modular, type-safe backend framework. This alpha release debuts a robust architecture with first-class type safety, powerful built-in features, and standalone adapters for extensibility and flexibility.

### Adapters Extracted to Standalone Packages

All adapters are now standalone packages:

- `@zyntra-js/adapter-redis` - Redis adapter for caching and pub/sub
- `@zyntra-js/adapter-bullmq` - BullMQ adapter for background jobs
- `@zyntra-js/adapter-opentelemetry` - OpenTelemetry adapter for telemetry
- `@zyntra-js/adapter-mcp-server` - MCP Server adapter for AI integrations

### Real-Time System

- **Type-Safe Events**: Type-safe, context-aware event publishing and subscription
- **Server-Sent Events**: Built-in SSE processor with automatic client management
- **Channel-Based**: Channel-based, namespaced communication with fine-grained access control
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection and event replay for reliable delivery
- **Strongly-Typed**: Strongly-typed event payloads and handler signatures

### Build-Time Extraction

- **Zero Bundle Contamination**: Resolved bundle contamination (2.3MB → 45KB)
- **Schema-Based Client**: Create schema-based client that eliminates bundle contamination
- **Type-Safe Client**: Generate type-safe client with zero server code contamination
- **Framework Detection**: Automatic framework detection and auto-configuration

### Turborepo Migration

Migrated repository to Turborepo monorepo structure for better build performance and developer experience.

## Breaking Changes

- **New Modular Package Architecture**: Adapters extracted into standalone packages
- **Updated Import Paths**: Updated import paths and API patterns
- **Client-Side Proxy**: Implemented client-side proxy to prevent handler execution

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed client error handling in createFetcher
- Fixed response processor to return structured error format
- Fixed request processor to handle optional middleware use array
- Fixed client environment detection and bundling issues
- Added 'use client' directive to zyntra.client.ts to resolve Next.js error

## Documentation

- Complete rewrite of README.md
- Added comprehensive guides for all starter applications
- Added MCP adapter documentation
