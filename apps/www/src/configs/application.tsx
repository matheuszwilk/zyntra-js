      question: "What makes ZyntraJS different from other frameworks?",
      answer:
        "ZyntraJS is designed specifically for modern TypeScript applications with a focus on end-to-end type safety, AI friendliness, and developer experience. Unlike traditional frameworks, it provides fully-typed RPC communication, works seamlessly across different runtimes, and offers built-in real-time capabilities and background jobs without complex setup.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use ZyntraJS with my existing framework?",
      answer:
        "Yes! ZyntraJS is framework-agnostic and works with any modern runtime or framework including Next.js, Express, Hono, Bun, and more. It's built on standard Web Request and Response APIs, so it integrates seamlessly with your existing tech stack without requiring major architectural changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the end-to-end type safety work?",
      answer:
        "ZyntraJS leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time guarantees across your entire application. When you define your API on the server, the client automatically gets fully-typed methods with IntelliSense and auto-completion. No schemas to share, no code generation - just pure TypeScript magic.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is ZyntraJS suitable for production applications?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! ZyntraJS is built with production workloads in mind, offering features like dependency injection, middleware support, real-time capabilities, background job processing, and comprehensive error handling. The framework is designed to scale with your application needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about Code Agents and developer experience?",
      answer:
        "ZyntraJS is designed for the future of development where humans and AI collaborate. The predictable structure, clear conventions, feature-sliced architecture, and comprehensive type system create a low-entropy environment that both developers and AI agents can easily understand and modify.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with ZyntraJS?",
      answer:
        "Getting started is simple! Use 'npx zyntra init' to create a new project, or install manually with npm/yarn. Our comprehensive documentation includes tutorials, examples, and best practices to help you get up and running quickly. You can have a working API in minutes.",
